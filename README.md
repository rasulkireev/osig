# OSIG

OSIG renders deterministic Open Graph and Twitter/X preview images from typed canvas specs.

Core references:

- AI agent usage through MCP: see [docs/agent-mcp.md](docs/agent-mcp.md)
- Repository publishing examples: see [docs/agent-repo-publishing.md](docs/agent-repo-publishing.md)
- Deterministic OG template starters: see [docs/template-library.md](docs/template-library.md)
- Self-hosting: see [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md)
- Human preview/export usage through the Studio API and account surfaces.

The legacy `/g` URL generator and fixed template contract have been removed. Agents should render previews and export image bytes through MCP or the Studio API instead of publishing query-string image URLs.

Hosted production usage should be paid and bounded; the open source app remains self-hostable.

## Development

Python dependencies are managed with `uv`.

Run the local Docker stack:

```bash
make serve
```

For native local commands outside Docker, create a local env file first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you are not running Docker Postgres locally, set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3` in `.env`.

For the fastest native MCP iteration loop, use the repo wrapper. It loads
`.env.example`, overlays `.env` when present, and uses sqlite by default when
`.env` is missing:

```bash
sh scripts/mcp-dev migrate
sh scripts/mcp-dev list
sh scripts/mcp-dev call get_image_contract --json
sh scripts/mcp-dev test
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

## Runtime Processes

Production builds one image from `deployment/Dockerfile`. The process is selected with `APP_PROCESS_TYPE`:

- `server`: Django ASGI app. Serves the website, Studio API routes, admin API routes, and the mounted FastMCP app at `/mcp`.
- `worker`: Django Q workers.
- `mcp`: optional standalone FastMCP Streamable HTTP sidecar from `mcp_http_server.py`.

The `server` process uses:

```bash
gunicorn osig.asgi:application --worker-class uvicorn_worker.UvicornWorker
```

The standalone MCP process uses:

```bash
sh scripts/mcp-dev http
```

By default, local MCP HTTP runs at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

Set `MCP_HOST`, `MCP_PORT`, or `MCP_PATH` to override that.

Both hosted and standalone HTTP MCP are configured with FastMCP stateless
Streamable HTTP. OSIG tools do not rely on MCP session state, and stateless mode
keeps requests reliable when the ASGI server runs multiple Gunicorn workers.

## MCP Trial Auth

MCP is intentionally narrow while it is easy to try from Codex and other agent clients.

Do not expose private/admin MCP tools while this remains public. Profile keys may be passed by `X-API-Key` or bearer auth for quota and paid watermark state. Set `OSIG_MCP_REQUIRE_AUTH=True`, or set `OSIG_MCP_TRIAL_ENABLED=False`, before treating hosted MCP as paid production access.

## Roadmap

- Add richer canvas primitives only when they stay deterministic and safe for hosted MCP.
- Add more font providers and provider font examples.
- Add more social/site presets.
- Reintroduce mandatory MCP auth before paid hosted production access.
