Stripe Notes:
- add only the secret key in the db
- when creating a webhook, specify the latest version from here https://stripe.com/docs/api/versioning
- create your products in stripe (monthly, annual and one-time, for example)
- the template assumes you have 3 products (hard coded, for now) monthly, annual and one-time. make sure to update the template with the correct plan id.
